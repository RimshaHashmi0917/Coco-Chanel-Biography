She later moved to Moulins, earned a living as a seamstress, and briefly tried a stage career, Singing in cabarets where she earned the nickname <strong>"Coco"</strong>, possibly inspired by the popular songs she performed.</p>
<h2>Career and Achievements</h2>
<p>Chanel's career began with the opening of a small hat shop in Paris in 1910, supported financially by her wealthy lover Arthur "boy" Capel. Inspired by the need for freedom and comfort in women's clothing, she quickly gained a reputation for modern, elegant designs that rejected the stiff corsetry and petticoats of the era. Over the following decades, Chanel established herself as a pioneering force in fashion, inventing timeless staples like the <strong>Chanel suit</strong>, <strong>the quilted purse</strong>, <strong>costume jewellery</strong>, and especially the iconic <strong>"little black dress"</strong>.</p>
<p>Her influence expanded well beyond fashion into accessories and scents, with the legendary Chanel No.5 perfume becoming a symbol of luxury and sophistication.</p>
